    "We regenerate predictions from an old dataframe, but this illustrates a useful pattern with REBOUND: It can be useful to separate the generation of initial conditions from the running of integrations, and to save the initial conditions as SimulationArchives (Rein & Tamayo 2017). This way you store your initial conditions in a binary, machine-independent format, whereas if you ran the same python script to generate initial conditions on different machines, you could get discrepancies in the last binary digit depending on the optimized math libraries used by the machine architecture. It is therefore much better to share SimulationArchives of initial conditions than a script to generate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show a sample process of loading SimulationArchives with initial conditions and using those to read the initial conditions to generate SPOCK predictions. Note that the Nbody wrapper in SPOCK by default will overwrite your SimulationArchive with all the additional snapshots when you save archives. That should be fine, but if for some reason it matters to you, you can easily instead append snapshots by doing things manually (see the bottom of this example: https://github.com/dtamayo/spock/blob/master/jupyter_examples/ComparingToNbody.ipynb)"

By default, `NbodyRegressor.predict_instability_time` integrates over 1e9 inner planet orbits (the length of time over which SPOCK is trained to make predictions). We also pass it the same filename of the SimulationArchive (again, this will overwrite the original file, which is fine). Finally we explicitly pass it the interval we want between snapshots (so that we end up with 1000 snapshots if the simulation is stable). Definitely see \n",
